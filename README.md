# Kalgoorlie_fault_network

This repository hosts some of the code dealing with the 3D modelling of the Kalgoorlie terrane fault network. The input data are derived from: 
1) geological maps (lithological and structural information), 
2) seismic data, which is based on previous interpretation from GSWA.
